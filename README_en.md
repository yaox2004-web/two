Full-stack data toolkit for China A-Share market — 15-layer architecture · 85 capability endpoints (80 primary + 5 backups) · 34 data sources · direct HTTP calls except two TCP client libraries (mootdx / baostock)

A self-contained Skill file that consolidates raw A-share and related market data from 34 sources into a ready-to-use toolkit for AI coding assistants. No need to memorize Tencent K-line paging parameters, the binary layout of TDX end-of-day packages, Eastmoney PDF Referer headers, or iwencai X-Claw authentication — it's all handled. And when a primary source bans you, there's a backup-source quick reference to fall back on.

> Compatible with [Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code) · [Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex) · [OpenClaw](https://github.com/anthropics/openclaw)
>
> The Skill file is structured Markdown + embedded Python. Any AI coding assistant with context injection can use it.

> **V3.9.0 (2026-09-20):** three new layers — futures & commodities, event-driven, convertible bonds — plus Tencent K-lines, the TDX official end-of-day package, Sina research reports, ETF shares, yield curves and more in the existing layers: 25 new entries in total. The broken TDX public-server K-line commands (#52) are now routed over HTTP. See the [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md) (Chinese).

## Quick Start

**3 steps, 2 minutes.**

```bash
# 1. Create skill directory
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/a-stock-data

# 2. Download SKILL.md
curl -o ~/.claude/skills/a-stock-data/SKILL.md \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simonlin1212/a-stock-data/main/SKILL.md

# 3. Install dependencies (V3.0: akshare no longer needed; V3.9 adds none)
pip install mootdx requests pandas stockstats numpy baostock xlrd openpyxl
```

Launch Claude Code and say "Check the valuation of 688017" — the skill activates automatically.

> **Codex / OpenClaw users:** Paste the contents of SKILL.md into your system prompt or project context file. The embedded Python code is ready to execute.

---

## 85 Endpoints

There are 80 primary entries and 5 backups. Counts refer to capability entries: CSI/CNI or SSE/SZSE routes within one function count once; helpers and research candidates are excluded.

> **Counting convention:** the tables below have 86 rows but count as 85 capability endpoints — "Eastmoney Industry Reports" shares **the same endpoint** as "Eastmoney reportapi" (only the `qType` parameter differs) and "THS Northbound (historical)" is a local self-built cache (not a separate endpoint), so neither is counted; the single "EM Intraday Anomaly Pool" row covers **two** endpoints (`list` / `count`), adding one back. 86 − 1 − 1 + 1 = 85. The ticker helper `to_joinquant()` is not counted.

From V3.9 the primary K-line source is Tencent, full-market daily bars can come from the TDX package, and report lists can come from Sina.

### Authentication

All integrated sources except iwencai require no user registration or API key. CSI, CNI and BSE (V3.8) and the 12 sources added in V3.9 (TDX official site, Wallstreetcn, CCTV, SSE e-Interaction, ChinaBond, China Money, the five futures exchanges, SGE) need no user credentials; BSE establishes an anonymous site cookie. Only iwencai semantic search requires an API key ([apply here](https://www.iwencai.com/skillhub)). Optional research candidates are excluded from these capabilities.

## Data Source Priority (V3.9 re-ranked by IP-ban risk)

> **Principle: if Tencent or an exchange / official body has it, don't use Eastmoney.** Quotes, K-lines, live prices, market cap and financial statements available from Tencent, official sources or Sina must come from them. mootdx quote commands return empty since 2026-09 (#52), so mootdx is only used for financial snapshots and F10. Eastmoney is only for its exclusive data, all routed through the throttled `em_get()`.

| Priority | Source | Protocol | IP Ban Risk | Use |

| **1 (top)** | Tencent Finance | HTTP | **Never banned** (one K-line host rate-limits after ~600 calls; three hosts rotate) | Live price / PE / PB / market cap / turnover / price limits / index / ETF / daily-weekly-monthly and minute K-lines |
| **2** | Exchanges / official bodies | HTTP | Very low (avoid bursts) | TDX package, SSE / SZSE / BSE, five futures exchanges, SGE, ChinaBond, China Money, CSI / CNI, PBoC, NBS |

| **4** | mootdx (TDX) | TCP 7709 | Never banned | Financial snapshots and F10 "latest notes" work; **K-lines / order book / ticks return empty since 2026-09 (#52)** |
| **4** | baostock | TCP | Low (no registration) | Valuation history PE/PB/PS/PCF + turnover + suspension + ST + listing/delisting dates (**no Beijing Exchange**) |
| Key required | iwencai | OpenAPI | Low | NL semantic report search (the only source that needs a key) |

> **Architecture:** Except mootdx and baostock (both TCP client libraries), all sources use direct HTTP API calls with no third-party data wrapper in between. **Eastmoney APIs are rate-limited; all calls go through `em_get()` for serial throttling. For batch jobs, increase `EM_MIN_INTERVAL`.**
>
> **Fallback:** When a primary source fails, check the "Backup Sources & Fallback Strategy" section in SKILL.md. Some core data types have independent backups on **different domains with separate rate limits**. Not every capability has a backup; always verify dates and completeness after fetching.

## FAQ

**Why are index weights not dated today? Can they be used for historical backtests?**
Constituents and weights may be published on different dates. The CNI endpoint returns a month-end snapshot; `date` is the source date. Current membership is not historical membership. This release does not integrate adjustment history or substitute zero for missing index PB.

**How do I run the two new backups?**
Execute the full Layer 12 code block in SKILL.md, then the official margin/BSE backup block. Query margin data separately for `SH` and `SZ`; BSE requires the expected session date. Date mismatches, incomplete pagination and unpublished data raise errors.

**mootdx returns no K-lines / `tdx_client()` says no server can return data (#52)**
Tested on 2026-09-20 on each of the 10 built-in servers: all accept TCP connections and return financials and ex-rights data, F10 only returns the "latest notes" category, and K-lines, order books and ticks come back with 0 rows. This is a server-side change; switching mootdx versions does not help. Alternatives:
> - SSE/SZSE daily / weekly / monthly K-lines (adjusted) and 1–60-minute bars → §1.5 `tencent_kline()`
> - Full-market SSE/SZSE/BSE daily bars for one trading day (with turnover value; the only daily-bar route for BSE) → §1.6 `tdx_daily_package()`
> - Live price and order book → §1.2 Tencent, or the official exchange books in the backup table
> - Financial snapshots / F10 "latest notes" → `tdx_client(check='finance')`, which still works; the other 8 F10 categories (company profile, shareholders, etc.) are no longer returned — see SKILL.md §6.2 for replacements
>
> In K-line mode `tdx_client()` probes servers first, so a full failure takes about a minute to raise.

**Are easy_tdx (PR #54) and the official THS API included?**
No. easy_tdx is another client for the same TDX protocol, not a new data source, and #52 is solved over HTTP, so PR #54 is not merged; this project only integrates sources it can query directly. The THS service requires a user key; auction integration needs Python 3.10+ compatibility work. See the [v3.8.0](docs/source-integration-v3.8.0.md) and [v3.9.0](docs/source-integration-v3.9.0.md) integration records (Chinese). V3.9 adds no installation dependencies.

**Can I backtest with it? Does it work with JoinQuant? (#55)**
This skill fetches data; it **has no backtesting engine**. Feed the data into your own framework or JoinQuant.
> - Tickers: `norm_ticker()` / `get_prefix()` accept JoinQuant codes `600519.XSHG` / `000001.XSHE`; `to_joinquant()` converts any supported form to JoinQuant codes. JoinQuant's public docs list no BSE suffix, so BSE codes raise an error instead of being guessed.
> - Adjustment: JoinQuant `get_price` defaults to forward adjustment (`fq='pre'`). Compare against §1.5 `tencent_kline(adjust='qfq')`, or apply the §1.4 adjust factors yourself.
> - Look-ahead bias: use §6.5 for historical valuation and §6.7 for historical industry membership; §12 index constituents are current snapshots only.

**Is Eastmoney the only research-report source? (#53)**
No. §2.4 `sina_research_reports()` is a second source that pages by stock or across the market and keeps working when Eastmoney blocks you. It has title, type, broker, analysts and date but no ratings or price targets; use Eastmoney reports or THS consensus for those.

**Are commodity futures and options covered? What about DCE? (#49)**
Yes, see Futures & Commodities. Official futures and options daily data come from SHFE, INE, CZCE, CFFEX and GFEX; member position rankings cover the first four (not GFEX). Sina real-time futures, FTSE China A50 and SGE spot are included too. **DCE's website blocks scripted access, so its daily quotes are not integrated**; use Sina real-time futures for DCE contracts such as soybean meal and iron ore.

**Why are cninfo IRM answers empty for Shanghai-listed companies?**
cninfo IRM only covers Shenzhen-listed companies; Shanghai tickers return 0 rows. Use §10.3 `sse_e_interaction()` (SSE e-Interaction) for Shanghai. Some companies genuinely have no replies in the last month, so an empty table can be correct.

## Verification

`python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v` extracts the shipped code directly from SKILL.md and checks dates, fields, symbol routing, units, pagination and error propagation without network access (140 offline tests as of V3.9).

Live tests are opt-in; the date must be a trading day the sources have already published:

```bash
# the 25 entries added in V3.9 (31 live calls)
ASTOCK_LIVE_V39=2026-09-18 python3 -m unittest tests.test_v39_sources -v
# the V3.8 official margin and BSE backups
ASTOCK_LIVE_TRADE_DATE=2026-09-04 ASTOCK_LIVE_MARGIN_DATE=2026-09-03 python3 -m unittest tests.test_official_data -v
```

Per-entry row counts and data boundaries are in the [v3.9.0 integration record](docs/source-integration-v3.9.0.md); V3.8 is in [v3.8.0](docs/source-integration-v3.8.0.md) (both Chinese).
